\section{Phase 4: CI/CD Integration and DevSecOps Pipeline}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automate build, test, and deployment of backend and frontend.
    \item Integrate security scanning at each stage.
    \item Ensure fast feedback for developers with CI/CD.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CI/CD Workflow}
We implemented GitHub Actions workflows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Checkout repository code.
    \item Install Node.js dependencies.
    \item Run backend tests.
    \item Build Docker images for backend and frontend.
    \item Scan images using Trivy for vulnerabilities.
    \item Deploy containers using Docker Compose.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Measures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ESLint for static code analysis.
    \item npm audit for dependency scanning.
    \item Trivy for container vulnerability scanning.
    \item GitHub secret scanning for sensitive information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Workflow triggered on every push to \texttt{main} branch.
    \item All tests pass, Docker images built and scanned successfully.
    \item Backend and frontend containers redeployed automatically.
    \item Logs show successful deployment and security scanning.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
This phase ensures a full **DevSecOps pipeline** where code changes are automatically tested, scanned, and deployed, maintaining security, quality, and speed of delivery.
